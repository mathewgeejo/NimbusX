## ‚úÖ Frontend-Backend Connection Status: **CONNECTED**

### Evidence from Logs:
```
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [04/Oct/2025 12:22:43] "OPTIONS /api/weather HTTP/1.1" 200
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [04/Oct/2025 12:22:46] "POST /api/weather HTTP/1.1" 200
```

- ‚úÖ Frontend at `localhost:3000` is sending requests
- ‚úÖ Backend at `localhost:5000` is receiving requests
- ‚úÖ CORS is working (OPTIONS preflight successful)
- ‚úÖ POST request successful (HTTP 200)
- ‚úÖ NASA API is being called successfully
- ‚úÖ Response is being sent back to frontend

## üî¥ Issues Found & Fixed:

### Issue 1: NASA Data Not Extracted Correctly
**Problem:** Month values coming back as None
```
Current values - Temp: None, Temp_min: None, Precip: None, Wind: None
```

**Fix Applied:** 
- Added debugging to see what keys NASA API returns
- Fixed month key formatting
- Will see actual keys in next request

### Issue 2: Gemini API Model Not Found
**Problem:** 
```
ERROR: 404 models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed to use `gemini-pro` first
- Added fallback to `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`
- Will gracefully fall back to rule-based summary if both fail

## üß™ To Verify Fixes:

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Click on any city** (e.g., Mumbai)
3. **Select a date** (e.g., 07-15)
4. **Click "Check Weather Probabilities"**
5. **Watch the backend terminal** - you should see:
   - "Looking for month key: XX"
   - "T2M_MAX keys available: [...]"
   - "Extracted values: temp_max=XX, precip=XX"
   - Probabilities calculated (not all 0.0)

## üìä Expected Behavior After Fixes:

### Before (What you saw):
```json
{
  "very_hot": 0.0,
  "very_cold": 0.0,
  "very_wet": 0.0,
  "very_windy": 0.0,
  "very_uncomfortable": 0.0
}
```

### After (What you should see):
```json
{
  "very_hot": 45.3,
  "very_cold": 12.1,
  "very_wet": 68.7,
  "very_windy": 32.4,
  "very_uncomfortable": 53.2
}
