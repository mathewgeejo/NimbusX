## 💡 Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Year-Aware Feature Engineering
```python
# Neural Model Features
year_offset = target_year - current_year
is_historical = target_year < current_year
is_forecast = target_year > current_year
climate_era = (target_year - 2020) / 50.0 if target_year >= 2020 else -1.0
long_term_cycle = np.sin(2 * np.pi * target_year / 100.0)
```

### 2. Multi-Year Training Data
```python
# ML Model Training Enhancement
train_year = np.random.randint(2015, 2031)  # 16-year span
climate_trend = (train_year - 2020) * 0.05  # 0.05°C per year warming
base_temp = base_temp + climate_trend
```

### 3. Temporal Consistency
- Year context propagates through entire prediction pipeline
- Consistent temporal features across neural, ML, and physics models
- Historical vs future prediction logic throughout system
