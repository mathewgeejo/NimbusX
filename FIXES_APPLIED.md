# ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied to NimbusX

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… 1. All Probabilities Showing 0.0%

**Problem:** The probability calculation function wasn't working correctly with the NASA data.

**Fix Applied:**
- Rewrote `calculate_percentile_probability()` in `backend/utils/probability.py`
- New algorithm uses percentile ranking instead of z-scores
- More accurate probability scaling based on where the value falls in the historical distribution

**How it works now:**
- If checking for "very hot" (>90th percentile):
  - Value at 95th percentile â†’ ~60-70% probability
  - Value at 90th percentile â†’ ~50% probability
  - Value at 50th percentile â†’ ~25% probability
  - Value at 10th percentile â†’ ~5% probability

### âœ… 2. Map Pin Selection Now Sets Location Name

**Problem:** Clicking on the map set coordinates but didn't update the location name field.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `handleMapClick()` in `frontend/src/App.js`
- Now automatically sets location name to coordinates when map is clicked
- Format: "Location: 19.08Â°, 72.88Â°"

**Code added:**
```javascript
const handleMapClick = (coords) => {
  console.log('Map clicked at:', coords);
  setLat(coords.lat.toFixed(4));
  setLon(coords.lng.toFixed(4));
  setLocation(`Location: ${coords.lat.toFixed(2)}Â°, ${coords.lng.toFixed(2)}Â°`);
};
```

### âœ… 3. Fixed .env File Loading

**Problem:** Gemini API key wasn't being loaded from .env file.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `backend/app.py` to use absolute path for .env file
- Added Path() to find the correct directory
- Now loads environment variables before importing other modules

**Code added:**
```python
from pathlib import Path
from dotenv import load_dotenv

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
ENV_PATH = BASE_DIR / '.env'
load_dotenv(dotenv_path=ENV_PATH)
```

### âœ… 4. Fixed NumPy Compatibility Issues

**Problem:** NumPy 1.26.2 had crashes with Python 3.13 on Windows.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `backend/requirements.txt` to use `numpy>=2.0.0`
- Removed pandas and scipy dependencies (not needed)
- Installed NumPy 2.3.3 which is stable with Python 3.13

### âœ… 5. Added Debug Logging

**Problem:** Hard to diagnose issues without seeing what data was being processed.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive logging to `backend/data_processor.py`
- Logs show:
  - NASA data keys received
  - Current month values (temp, precip, wind)
  - Annual data lengths
  - Calculated probabilities with percentile thresholds

## How to Test the Fixes

### Test 1: Mumbai in Monsoon Season (Should show HIGH probabilities)
```json
{
  "lat": 19.076,
  "lon": 72.8777,
  "location": "Mumbai",
  "date": "07-15"
}
```
**Expected:** Very Wet should be 70-90%

### Test 2: Dubai in Summer (Should show HIGH heat)
```json
{
  "lat": 25.2048,
  "lon": 55.2708,
  "location": "Dubai",
  "date": "08-01"
}
```
**Expected:** Very Hot and Very Uncomfortable should be 80-95%

### Test 3: Reykjavik in Summer (Should show moderate/low)
```json
{
  "lat": 64.1466,
  "lon": -21.9426,
  "location": "Reykjavik",
  "date": "06-15"
}
```
**Expected:** All probabilities should be low-moderate

### Test 4: Map Selection
1. Click "Show Map Selector"
2. Click anywhere on the map
3. Verify that:
   - Latitude field updates
   - Longitude field updates
   - Location name shows coordinates
   - Marker appears on map

## Location Selection - You Can Now:

1. **âœ… Use Popular Cities** - Click quick-select buttons
2. **âœ… Search for Cities** - Type in the search box (10 major cities available)
3. **âœ… Click on Map** - Click anywhere in the world
4. **âœ… Manual Coordinates** - Type exact lat/lon for ANY location
5. **âœ… Mix and Match** - Use map to find location, then adjust coordinates manually

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app.py` - Fixed .env loading
2. `backend/utils/probability.py` - Rewrote probability calculation
3. `backend/data_processor.py` - Added debug logging
4. `backend/requirements.txt` - Updated numpy version, removed pandas/scipy
5. `frontend/src/App.js` - Fixed map click handler to set location name

## Next Steps to Verify

1. **Restart Backend:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ADMIN\Downloads\NimbusX\backend
   .\venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
   ```

2. **Reload Frontend:**
   - Refresh the browser at http://localhost:3000
   - Or restart with `npm start` if needed

3. **Test Different Locations:**
   - Try Mumbai in July (monsoon) - should show high "Very Wet"
   - Try Dubai in August (summer) - should show high "Very Hot"
   - Try polar regions - should show high "Very Cold"
   - Try clicking on map in different regions

4. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Backend terminal will show detailed processing logs
   - Browser console (F12) will show map click events
   - Look for probability calculations in backend logs

## Known Improvements

The probability calculations are now much more realistic:
- âœ… Uses actual percentile rankings
- âœ… Scales probabilities based on position in distribution
- âœ… Returns values across full 0-100% range
- âœ… Handles edge cases (no variation, missing data)
- âœ… Includes error handling and logging

## Gemini API Integration

The Gemini API will now work correctly since the .env file loads properly. You should see natural language summaries like:

- "Mid-July in Mumbai falls during monsoon season, with an extremely high chance of heavy rainfall (92%)..."
- "Early August in Dubai brings extreme heat (96% probability)..."
- "Weather conditions in New York during January are typically mild..."
